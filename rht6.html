            <p>Ilyas Kashmiri, the head of the terrorist group Harkat-Ul-Jehadi Islami, is the fifth most wanted criminal in India. <br><br> Ilyas is an Al Qaeda member who carried out the explosion at the German Bakery in Pune, the Mumbai attack on November 11, 2002, the attack on the American Center in Kolkata, and the explosions in Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, and Jaipur in 2008.
                 <br><br> He was reportedly killed in a US drone strike in 2011, however this was later disputed. <br><br>
                 Ilyas Kashmiri, also referred to as Maulana Ilyas Kashmiri,Mufti Ilyas Kashmiri and Muhammad Ilyas Kashmir  (10 February 1964[5] â€“ 3 June 2011), was a Pakistani ex-Special Forces Islamist guerrilla insurgent who fought against Indian troops in Kashmir. <br><br>

                 NBC News reported that United States officials had mentioned him as a possible successor to Osama bin Laden as head of Al-Qaeda. <br><br> Prior to his death, a CNN News headline called him the "most dangerous man on Earth", while the late journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad said of him that "he is invariably described by the world intelligence agencies as the most effective, dangerous, and successful guerrilla leader in the world." <br><br></p>

        <p>Physically described by the US Department of State as "approximately six feet tall" and weighting "about 200 pounds", Kashmiri was born on 10 February 1964 in Bhimber, in the Samahni Valley of Kashmir , Pakistan. 
         <br><br>    Kashmiri was reported by some media sources as having served in the Pakistan Army's elite Special Services Group (SSG), however he denied this in an interview with journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad. <br><br> Kashmiri also spent a year studying communications at the Allama Iqbal University. <br><br> He also studied for some time in Karachi's Jamia Uloom-ul-Islamia, a madrasa known to produce Islamist militants, where he'd form, with two follow students, the nucleus of what would become the first jihadi outfit of the country, Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI). <br><br>

            In the Soviet war in Afghanistan, he trained the Afghan mujahideen in mine warfare in Miranshah on behalf of Pakistan. <br><br> During the fighting he lost an eye and an index finger. <br><br> He continued his militant activities in Kashmir after the war as a member of Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI), though disagreements with leader Qari Saifullah Akhtar several years after initially joining in 1991 led Kashmiri to establish his own new unit within HuJI known as the 313 Brigade.
            
            During the mid-1990s, Kashmiri and Nasrullah Mansoor Langrial were near Poonch when they were seized by the Indian Army and sent to prison, where he would spend the next two years before escaping and returning to Pakistan. <br><br> Upon his return Kashmiri continued to conduct operations against India. <br><br> He was reportedly being rewarded personally with Rs 100,000 (about US$1,164.24) by then Army Chief General Pervez Musharraf for presenting the severed head of Bhausaheb Maruti Talekar, an Indian Army Soldier to him.
            <br><br>
            Pictures of Kashmiri with the head of the soldier in his hands were published in some Pakistani newspapers.</p>

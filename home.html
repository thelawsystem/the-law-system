    <p>There is a rise in the amount of crime in our country and most of the people are unaware of the criminal laws under IPC (Indian Penal Code). Therefore it becomes necessary to make the citizens aware of all kinds of laws put forth by our constitution against crime so that people come forward to register case against it.</p>

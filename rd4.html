    <h1>CONTRACT LAW</h1><br><br>
    <p class="in">Contract law is a set of rules that govern agreements between two or more parties. <br> A contract is a legally binding agreement that outlines the terms and conditions of a transaction or relationship. <br><br>

        Contract law sets out the following key elements that are necessary for a contract to be enforceable:</p><br>
  <ol>
    <li>Offer: One party makes an offer to another party.</li><br>
    <li>Acceptance: The other party accepts the offer.</li><br>
    <li>Consideration: Both parties must provide something of value in exchange for the agreement.</li><br>
    <li>Intent: Both parties must intend to create a legally binding agreement.</li><br>
    <li>Legality: The subject matter of the contract must be legal.</li><br>
  </ol><br>
  <p class="in1">In simpler terms, contract law is the set of rules that governs how people and businesses make and keep agreements with each other, <br>and what happens when one party fails to keep their end of the bargain.</p><br>
    <h4>TYPES:</h4>
    <p class="in2">There are several types of Contract Law</p><br>
    <ol>
        <li>Express Contracts: An express contract is one in which the terms and conditions of the agreement are explicitly stated in writing or verbally.</li><br>
        <li>Implied Contracts: An implied contract is one in which the terms and conditions of the agreement are not explicitly stated, but can be inferred from the conduct of the parties involved.</li><br>
        <li>Unilateral Contracts: A unilateral contract is one in which one party makes an offer that can only be accepted by the other party performing a specific action.</li><br>
        <li>Bilateral Contracts: A bilateral contract is one in which both parties make promises to each other to perform certain actions.</li><br>
        <li>Executed Contracts: An executed contract is one in which both parties have fulfilled their obligations under the agreement.</li>

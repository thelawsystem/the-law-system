            <p>Mohammad Masood Azhar Alvi is a radical Islamist and terrorist, being the founder and leader of the Pakistan-based terrorist organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed, active mainly in the Pakistani-administered portion of the Kashmir region. <br><br>
                 His actions are not limited to the South Asian region; for instance, BBC News described him as "the man who brought jihad to Britain. <br> <br> " On 1 May 2019, Masood Azhar was listed as an international terrorist by the United Nations Security Council. <br><br>
                 In early 1994, Azhar travelled to Srinagar under a fake identity, to ease tensions between Harkat-ul-Ansar's feuding factions of Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami and Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. <br><br> India arrested him in February from Khanabal near Anantnag and imprisoned him for his terrorist activities with the groups. <br><br> On being arrested, he said "Soldiers of Islam have come from 12 countries to liberate Kashmir. <br><br> We will answer your carbines with rocket launchers"  He was imprisoned at the Badami Bagh Cantonment in Srinagar, Tihar Jail in Delhi, and lastly the Kot Balwal Jail in Jammu (from where he would eventually be released).[13][14]

                 In July, 1995, six foreign tourists were kidnapped in Jammu and Kashmir. <br><br> The kidnappers, referring to themselves as Al-Faran (a pseudonym of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen), included the release of Masood Azhar among their demands. <br><br> One of the hostages managed to escape whilst another was found in a decapitated state in August. <br><br> The others were never seen or heard from since 1995. <br><br> FBI had interrogated Azhar multiple times during his jail-stay on the locus of the kidnappings.

            <p>Major Iqbal, one of the 26/11 attack conspirators, is the second most wanted felon on the list. <br><br> He is an ISI official and a major in the Pakistani army. <br><br> David Headley, a Pakistani-American businessman who earlier served as an informant for the US Drug and Enforcement Administration, personally recruited, trained, and oversaw Major Iqbal as his chief representative for his reconnaissance operations in India. <br><br>
                WASHINGTON: He's acquiring the status of mythic villain, and Bollywood scriptwriters may soon caricature him in the mold of Mogambo and Shakaal, among their more famous screen scoundrels.
                But the way David Headley aka Daood Gilani describes him, Major Iqbal was not given to loud laughs or corny dialogues. <br><br> A serving ISI officer, he was a cold, calculating operational mastermind of the Mumbai 26/11 terrorist attack who handled its logistical aspects, including forking out the money, choosing targets, and liaised with other shadowy ISI operatives and terrorist outfits.

    <p>Mumbai attack accused Tahawwur Rana opposes extradition to India
        Rana, 59, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was re-arrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. <br><br> He has been declared a fugitive by India.
    <br><br>Headly says"Major Iqbal" disclosed to him that a previously scheduled attack on Mumbai in September 2008 had to be abandoned after terrorist deployed for the purpose lost their mornings--and their boat. <br><br>
    He also advised Headly to befriend influential people"who live in military facilities" in india, and while he was thrilled with the advances the Pakistani-American made in infiltrating Shiv Sena, he was disappointed that Headly did not scout the Mumbai airport as a target.

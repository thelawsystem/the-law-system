   <h1>CIVIL LAW</h1>
<br><br>
<p>Civil law is a legal system that deals with private disputes between individuals or organizations. It is different from criminal law, which deals with crimes and punishments. <br><br>

    Civil law is concerned with issues such as contracts, property, family matters, and personal injuries. It provides a way for individuals to seek compensation or resolution for harm caused by another party's actions or negligence. <br><br>
    
    In civil law, cases are typically brought by one party against another party, and a judge or jury decides the outcome. The decision may involve awarding damages, requiring one party to fulfill their contractual obligations, or granting an injunction to prevent a harmful action from taking place. <br><br>
    
    Overall, civil law is an important part of legal systems around the world, providing a means for individuals to seek justice and resolve disputes peacefully</p>
